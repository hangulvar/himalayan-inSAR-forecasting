# 🚦 SESSION REVIEW — Start Here

**This is the first file to read when starting a new session.** It has two blocks:

- **LIVE** — regenerated at the end of each session (by `/wrap-session`): current state, next step, uncommitted delta.
- **STABLE** — read order, environment gotchas, open questions, roadmap: edited only when a fact changes, never rewritten per session.

**House rule: no headline KPI/score is restated in this file.** Every number lives once, in
`RESULTS_AND_KPIS.md` — this file cites the § only. (Pre-streamline verbose version archived at
`docs/archive/local/SESSION_REVIEW_pre-streamline_2026-07-03.md` and in git history.)

# LIVE — Session 31 · branch `aoi-vaishnodevi` · updated 2026-07-28

## Current state

- **★ NEW (§68) — the FLASH-FLOOD EXPANSION is PLANNED, nothing built.** Committed plan:
  `docs/references/FLOOD_EXPANSION_PLAN_2026-07-28.md` — an additive-only, config-gated
  (`flood:` block absent = off) arm: **F0** geometry probe (D8 channels/catchments via the
  *shared* `flow_routing_probe` functions + coverage guard) → **F1** catchment-aggregated
  IMERG burst staging (EXPERIMENTAL framing, the §55 lifecycle) → **F2** creep×flood
  undercut coupling (read-only against `alerts_operational.json`) → **F3** deferred menu.
  **Scope verdict recorded:** Regime A only (tributary flash floods / toe erosion — a
  landslide *trigger*, so it deepens the core product); mainstem Chenab + calibrated
  inundation depth EXCLUDED; the **InSAR AOI is never enlarged** — the frame DEMs already
  span the catchment terrain (§68) and a data-only "hydrological support domain" does the
  rest. Test contract (plan §7): baseline-freeze byte-identity manifest written FIRST,
  hermetic units, negative-controlled guards, verified-event replays.
- **★ NISAR "fresh batch" VERIFIED as old news (§68).** The 20 Jul 2026 announcement is the
  public release of the provisional `P05023` stream **§65 already ingested**: 0 new
  acquisitions / 0 reprocessing over either AOI as of 2026-07-28; newest GUNW still ASC-156
  07 Jul×19 Jul. The monsoon void re-score stays **blocked on data** (next ASC-156 pass
  ~early Aug; reprocessed/back-catalog releases promised through end-2026). Bonus find:
  **11 NISAR L3 SME2 soil-moisture products** over the AOIs (flood-plan F3 option).
- **Session 30's five batches (§63–§67) are ALL COMMITTED** (`2a13fd0`…`7df55e0`); the tree
  was clean before this session's doc-only delta. Battery not re-run this session (docs
  only; Docker down by preference) — the committed **114-green** state (§67) stands.
- **⚠ Known fragility, guarded (carried §64):** burst k=2.40 sits 1.6% under the fatal floor;
  the `test_tier34.py` margin guard is the tripwire — re-derive k, don't edit the test.
- **(§62 carried, now PAST its expected latency)** — the 22 Jul Gangroo–Ramsu daily-arm
  confirmation expected ~27 Jul via ERA5-Land; a `live_alarm.py` re-run is now the cheapest
  pending action on the board (the skill table picks it up automatically).
- **DEFERRED, deliberately (carried §61):** the S1A-only Ramban rebuild rescore — judgment-
  heavy, needs the cross-frame-merge design decision, run WITH the user; not headless.
- **⚠ USER REVIEW still open (§52):** 2 inventory rows, evidence gathered, verdict pending.
- **⚠ Still open from the §66 scan (LOW):** no CSRF/`Origin` check on the panel's `POST /run`;
  `_serve_file` whole-file reads; old pinned micromamba base tag.
- **BOTH sites in WATCH (§54)**; Ramban COMPLETE/scored/LIVE (§21b, §44), VD validated +
  site-tuned (§26–§32); merge `aoi-vaishnodevi` → `master` remains the user's call. Active
  hardening plan: `docs/references/STRENGTHENING_PLAN_2026-07-18.md` (Tiers 0–4 ✅ except
  4b soil lab = user, 4d frames-101/102 ERA5 rescue = deferred).
- **Honest limits carried:** creep core 0 vs corridor inventory (CV3); 598 m miss (§31/§51);
  soils literature-corroborated not lab-measured (§37/§39/§42/§47); §40 GACOS pair open;
  Drive copy of raw zips is the only archival source (§48).

## Recommended next step

**Cheapest first: re-run `live_alarm.py` to settle §62's daily-arm verdict** (its ERA5-Land
window has now published). Then either (a) the standing **§61 S1A-only rebuild rescore in a
focused session WITH the user** (design decision on the f105/f103 chain-join first), or
(b) **start the flood arm at F0** per the plan — in which case the FIRST act is
`tests/test_flood_invariants.py` + the baseline-freeze manifest (needs Docker for the
battery). User-side (standing): settle the 2 §52 rows; GACOS form + soil lab; merge to
`master`; publish the dashboard.

## Uncommitted delta

**Docs only — no code, no data products, no config:**
- `docs/references/FLOOD_EXPANSION_PLAN_2026-07-28.md` (NEW — plan, scope verdict, test contract),
- `RESULTS_AND_KPIS.md` (§68), `SESSION_REVIEW.md` (this LIVE block + one STABLE §4 line),
- `session_journey.md` (git-ignored) S31 entry.
Scratch ASF probes stayed in the session scratchpad (never entered the repo).

# STABLE — edit only when a fact changes (never rewrite per session)

## 1. Read these documents, in this order

| # | Document | Why read it | How much |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SESSION_REVIEW.md** (this file) | Current state, open questions, next step | LIVE block + skim STABLE |
| 2 | **`RESULTS_AND_KPIS.md`** | **Committed** ledger of every headline KPI/finding (mock + real), with provenance | Skim; read the newest §§ |
| 3 | `README.md` | Project overview, repo layout, full-pipeline run guide, known env issues | Skim |
| 4 | `milestone.md` | Plain-language story of progress | Top to current |
| 5 | `session_journey.md` | Slim per-session bullets (what/why/dead-ends); older entries are long-form | Newest 1–2 entries |
| 6 | `error_history_log.md` | Every bug + root cause + fix — **check before debugging anything** | Scan headings |
| 7 | `docker/README.md` | How to build/run the pipeline in the Linux container | As needed |
| 8 | `docs/guides/Foundations - Physics and Maths Primer.md` | The science (Phases 1–4 + forecasting/rainfall/validation) | As needed |
| 9 | `InSAR_hazard_forecasting_Context.md` | Original vision / full expansion roadmap | Reference |

**Also re-read `CLAUDE.md`** — behavioural rules + the documentation ritual (§5: run `/wrap-session` before stopping).

> **Docs restructured 2026-07-17:** all reading material (guides, runbooks, field briefs,
> references, archive) now lives under `docs/` — start at `docs/INDEX.md`, which also maps every
> old path to its new home. The functional docs in the table above stay at the project root.

> **Committed vs local-only (verified 2026-06-07 via `git ls-files`):** `CLAUDE.md` and
> `session_journey.md` are **git-ignored / untracked** (local-only working notes), as is most of `data/`.
> **`SESSION_REVIEW.md` (this file), `milestone.md`, and `.claude/commands/` are TRACKED** — a fresh clone
> gets this dashboard, the milestones, and the `/wrap-session` command, alongside the always-committed
> `README.md`, `RESULTS_AND_KPIS.md`, `error_history_log.md`, the Foundations primer, and
> `InSAR_hazard_forecasting_Context.md` — but NOT `session_journey.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. The user commits manually.

## 2. CRITICAL environment gotcha (read before running anything)

**Two ways to run, pick one — don't mix:**

- **In Docker (preferred):** `docker compose run --rm insar python …`. numpy/BLAS work natively;
  activation automatic; the Windows bug class below cannot occur. Needs Docker Desktop (WSL2) running.
  **NOTE: matplotlib `savefig` crashes NATIVELY (exit 127) — run anything that plots in Docker** (the
  scored back-test + the rainfall sweep both plot, so always run them in the container).
- **Native Windows (legacy):** run compute scripts with the **conda env activated**, or rely on the
  in-script DLL bootstrap. Launching `python.exe` by full path *without* activation → numpy can't find
  its BLAS DLLs → **`0xC06D007F`** (DLL-load failure, not a numerical bug). Keep `logging` ASCII.
  Native `gdalwarp` etc. live in `C:\Users\varun\.conda\envs\insar_qa_env\Library\bin` (prepend to PATH).

- Env (native): `insar_qa_env` at `C:\Users\varun\.conda\envs\insar_qa_env\`.
- HyP3 credits: **~7,430 as of 2026-07-22** (§61 — 30 spent on the Ramban rebuild; was 7,460). Radar library 238 products. Disk: ~46 GB in `data/` (§48 — raw zips Drive-archived + deleted 2026-07-15).
- The container: `docker compose build` then e.g.
  `docker compose run --rm insar python workflows/agentic_orchestrator.py`. Code + `data/` bind-mounted at `/app`.
- **WSL2/Docker resource caps live in `C:\Users\varun\.wslconfig`** (6 GB / 6 CPU, added 2026-07-15 §48) —
  raise temporarily for heavy MintPy sessions, then `wsl --shutdown`.
- **`data\raw_zips` is an NTFS junction → `C:\InSAR_data\raw_zips`.** Containers can't see through
  junctions — compose nested-binds the real folder (both services).
- **Start/stop Docker ONLY via `docker desktop start` / `docker desktop stop` (CLI, 4.37+).**
  Force-killing the processes DETERMINISTICALLY bricks the next start (stale unix socket in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\run\` → error dialog). If already bricked: quit the dialog, rename that
  `run` dir, `docker desktop start` (error log 2026-07-15/16).

## 3. Open questions — "deepen trust" or "scale/deploy"

The core vision is fully built and scored above chance. Remaining work:

0. **Infrastructure & portability:** Infra 0a/0b DONE. **Multi-AOI productization DONE (2026-07-12):**
   per-AOI config registry (`config/*.yaml`, root `config.yaml` = one-line `active_config` pointer),
   `INSAR_CONFIG` env override (per-command AOI targeting for every script), soil parameters moved into
   config (`soil:` block — no more silent Ramban-default inheritance), `workflows/aoi_status.py`
   (multi-AOI stage/alarm dashboard + deterministic next step), `docs/runbooks/NEW_AOI_PLAYBOOK.md` (onboarding
   runbook), `tests/test_config_registry.py`. ~~Fold the <150 m perpendicular-baseline gate into
   rescues~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-13 (§43 — one standing f106 bridge measured 151 m; a better
   replacement is queued and applies at the next radar-cadence rebuild). Still: AOI guidance
   (a better polygon improves *targeting*, not the noise floor).
   **New-AOI replication readiness:** infra replicability HIGH (config-driven, Dockerized, multi-stack);
   scientific transferability MEDIUM — a new AOI needs (a) ~2–3 months of S1 acquisitions for a velocity
   baseline, (b) a site soil check (Ramban field-calibrated §20; VD literature-corroborated §37 — each
   new site needs its own pass, now recorded in its registry file; **measured to be load-bearing, §42 —
   failure depth especially**), (c) a local inventory for validation
   — the three manual steps the playbook and status dashboard track explicitly.
0b. **GACOS second pull — tooling ready (2026-07-16):** `workflows/gacos_request.py` prints the
   exact form values (bbox, per-track UTC time, missing dates only); `workflows/gacos_ingest.py`
   turns the email tarball into cross-check-ready tifs + the STACKS snippet. The remaining §40
   work is: submit the form, wait for the email, run ingest, run `_gacos_crosscheck.py`.
1. **Accuracy backlog — the ranked plan is COMPLETE:** see `docs/archive/Science Upgrade Plan - Top 3
   (2026-07-13).md` — ~~(1) bootstrap CIs + ablation-baseline ladder~~ ✅ DONE (§44,
   `validation_stats.py`), ~~(2) TWI-distributed saturation m_i~~ ✅ DONE (§45, kappa=0.06 adopted
   both sites; broke VD's §44 slope-only tie), ~~(3) nonlinear van-Genuchten suction curve~~ ✅
   RESOLVED (§46 — mechanism shipped config-gated, adoption rejected: (α,n) not identifiable from a
   spatial inventory; linear stands on evidence). Still behind those:
   lab confirmation of c_dry/c_wet; per-stack ERA5 reference-pixel + unwrapping QC (rescue
   frame102/101, §22).
2. **Visualization:** combined interactive 3-D dashboard over the UNION mosaic; ASC/DESC vertical+EW
   decomposition (DEFERRED — needs better DESC: longer connected series / PS / phase-linking).
3. **Make it live / smarter:** ✅ live rainfall ingestion DONE (`live_alarm.py` incremental ERA5-Land
   + one-command alarm regen; 2–3-day runbook 2026-07-11). ✅ **Sub-daily IMERG burst gate DONE
   2026-07-18 (§55, experimental second opinion** — `imerg_gate.py` + dashboard card + non-fatal
   live_alarm hook). ~~earning this arm back-tested operating points~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-25 (§63 —
   false-alarm rate measured against the validated arm on one yardstick; §64 — ALERT k lowered
   3.0→2.4 on that evidence, all 4 fatal events now caught at Δ=0). Remaining: per-zone IMERG
   from the 0.1° grid. Still
   open: real flow-routing for LLOF (replace TWI proxy); hybrid LLM ("rules decide, LLM narrates").
4. **Deploy/polish:** hosted Streamlit version of the 3-D dashboard.
5. **NISAR (step-change): the forward stream ARRIVED 2026-07 as predicted (§65).** L-band recovers
   coherence over vegetation (our worst enemy, §59: 75–87% of C-band's failure class) + ships
   geocoded interferograms via ASF. **Now the freshest radar over Ramban by ~10 weeks.** ~~Track ASF
   availability~~ ✅ done (watcher). **Open:** the monsoon L-vs-C confirmation is blocked by NaN
   voids over both AOIs in the provisional (`_PR_`/`P05023`) granules — n=2, systematic. Re-check
   after NASA reprocesses, or when an acquisition lands with our footprint outside the void; scoring
   is one command (`nisar_coherence_pilot.py --season monsoon`) and aborts honestly if still void.
   (2026-07-28 §68: the publicized "fresh batch" = the 20 Jul public release of this same stream —
   nothing new over our AOIs yet.)
   Also newly available and unexploited: **DESC track-135 L-band GUNWs** — a possible route back to
   the ASC/DESC vertical+EW decomposition that C-band DESC was too noisy for (Area 2).

**Exception to MVP-first (always):** fix correctness/data-integrity bugs immediately; defer quality-only
improvements until shown to matter.

## 4. Expansion roadmap — areas of exploration toward a robust forecasting tool

§3 above is the *near-term hardening backlog*; this is the broader strategic menu (mirrored in
`InSAR_hazard_forecasting_Context.md` for durability). Each **AREA is self-contained**.

**Where the MVP is weakest today:** ~30 mm/yr velocity noise floor; single-look (no true 3-D motion);
uniform soil strength (site-corroborated §20/§37, but one value per AOI) + dry/sat end-members +
TWI-proxy downstream flag; rainfall now two-arm (daily AOI-mean validated + sub-daily IMERG
experimental §55) but still not per-zone, and the burst arm's operating points rest on n=7 events
(its alarm COST is now measured, §63; its skill is still a small calibration set, not a
validation); a static-vs-worst-case hazard map; recall-limited validation on two small AOIs.

- **Area 1 — Noise reduction:** MintPy ERA5 (done on frame106), ✅ GACOS cross-check (VD, §40 — mixed
  first result, worth a second pull), DEM-error +
  coherence-weighted inversion, phase-linking/DS methods (recover vegetated slopes), <150 m Bperp rule.
- **Area 2 — Signal strengthening:** ASC/DESC → vertical+EW (needs better DESC), PS points on rock/infra,
  longer series → seasonal vs steady-creep split.
- **Area 3 — Map → FORECAST:** inverse-velocity TTF (built), regional ID thresholds (built/verified),
  TWI-distributed saturation ✅ DONE (§45, kappa=0.06); still: calibrated spatially-varying soil,
  real flow-routing for LLOF.
- **Area 4 — Validation & uncertainty:** scored back-test DONE (§16); uncertainty quantification DONE (§24);
  next = a susceptibility model (LR/RF) cross-check + a verified-date temporal test.
- **Area 5 — Multi-sensor corroboration (GEE):** CHIRPS/IMERG/ERA5-Land rainfall, SMAP/ASCAT soil moisture,
  SoilGrids strength, DEM upgrades, WorldCover/NDVI veg masks, Sentinel-2/Landsat optical change, NASA GLC.
- **Area 6 — Operationalize:** ✅ live rainfall ingestion (done — `live_alarm.py` + runbook); hybrid LLM,
  hosted + union 3-D dashboard.
- **Area 7 (physics borrows):** #1 snowmelt/freeze-thaw (done), #2 V_slope (done), #3 regional ID + K_sn,
  #4 matric-suction FS split (done §20; nonlinear van-Genuchten curve BUILT + evaluated §46 —
  rejected on identifiability, config-gated for when lab/temporal data exists).
- **Area 8 — Flash-flood & undercut arm (PLANNED 2026-07-28, §68):** additive, config-gated,
  Regime-A-only (tributary flash floods / toe erosion); plan of record =
  `docs/references/FLOOD_EXPANSION_PLAN_2026-07-28.md` (F0–F3 phases, scope exclusions, test contract).
- **Data upgrade — NISAR (NASA-ISRO, L+S band):** the top future SAR upgrade (L-band beats vegetation
  decorrelation, our worst enemy); operational window from Jul 2026.

**Suggested priority:** (1) ✅ operational two-factor warning + per-zone (§16–§19); (2) ✅ physics/data
upgrades (§20–§21); (3) ✅ recall two-tier + uncertainty + triage (§23–§25); (4) ✅ live rainfall
(`live_alarm.py` + runbook); (5) NISAR ingestion as it matures; (6) susceptibility cross-check
(~~nonlinear suction~~ ✅ resolved §46 — rejected on evidence).

**Robustness in one line:** corroborate InSAR creep with optical change, real rainfall, soil moisture, and a
validated inventory — never trust a single sensor or a single physics assumption.

## 5. End-of-session ritual

Run **`/wrap-session`** before stopping — it appends KPIs to `RESULTS_AND_KPIS.md`, logs bugs, writes the
slim `session_journey.md` entry, adds milestone/primer entries on a completed phase, regenerates the LIVE
block above, and drafts the commit message (the user commits manually). Per-session checklists no longer
accumulate here — that history lives in `session_journey.md` + `git log` (older checklists: see the
archived pre-streamline snapshot).
